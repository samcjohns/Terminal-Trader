Current Version: v0.12
Game Name: Terminal Trader
Shorthand: tetrad

Update Ideas:
- More random events
- Settings for how the game behaves (affects constants)
- Print something after each advance, like how much money gained or lost
- File that holds names of all active users, can be used in the "Load Game" menu
  - this would also solve the overwriting issue
- History of stock purchases with time stamps
- ChatGPT written descriptions for stocks
- System.in.read() for instant commands rather than numbers and enter
- Add "Command Tray" at the bottom with all possible commands for the given menu
- Add 100 Day change to main stock menu
- "Challenge Saves" saves that lock down at 

FIXME:
- Add Average value to main stock menu
- Stop pushing references around, make them package private and access them from Game (game.mkt)
